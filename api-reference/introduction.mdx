## Base URL

Website's API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```bash Terminal
https://guest-house-backend.onrender.com/
```

## Response Codes

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here are a few examples:

| Code  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | The request was successful.                                                                    |
| `400` | The request was invalid or cannot be served.                                                   |
| `401` | The request requires user authentication.                                                      |
| `403` | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.                                |
| `404` | The requested resource could not be found.                                                     |
| `500` | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
